The concept
-----------

The idea of writing a blog came to my mind long time ago. I started two times, but finally the
third is the good one. First because I found a good platform to write posts and create my own
design and second because I already have a bunch of stories to write about.

This first post (the second really) is about the blog itself. Not only from the code point
of view, but also from the design and concept perspectives.

The name's origin is pretty clear. It is [René Descartes] "[Cogito]" with a geek twist ;) 
The point is that you cannot code without thinking, but... do we always think as hard as we
should? For the favicon, I will let the reader find out what it is!

At the beggining I wanted to focus on the "thinking" part and [Rodin]'s [Thinker] came to my 
mind. Later I changed my mind to focus on the "programming side", then I decided to use a
computer picture as the background. I considered "famous" computers as [HAL 9000] and [Eniac], 
in the end I used the latter one, focusing in the old times of computing.

The looks are "old style" or "vintage" as modern people like to call it nowadays. I wanted to
reflect the origins of this craft and that is why the colors are dark and greenish (like my
first monitor ;)

The implementation
------------------

I saw some premade themes and sites done with [Jekyll], but finally I started from scratch to
have the minimal code I needed for my blog and to customize it freely from the start.

In order to blog with [Jekyll], you have to install the following software in your system:
Ruby, Gem , Jekyll (obvious), Python, Pygments (for syntax highlighting).
    
Then, to create the site structure, you have to execute the command
`jekyll new <user>.github.io`. This will generate the minimum files required by Jekyll to build
a site. The name doesn't need to follow that naming pattern if you are going to host the site
outside [Github].

For the design I chose Twitter [Bootstrap]. Anyway I didn't wanted my blog to look like the 
hundreds of sites using [Bootstrap], so I looked for a custom theme. I found very good 
templates in [Start Bootstrap]. Like these two which I used for some parts of the design:

* [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/modern-business)
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/grayscale)

To generate the base (static) site I used html5 boilerplate (in a tool of my own called
[Webstrap]). The skeleton generated by this tool contains: `crossdomain.xml`, 
`humans.txt` & `robots.txt` from HTML5 Boilerplate.

The icons I use are taken from [Font Awesome] however I created a custom font using [IcoMoon]
for the icons I could not find there.

To make the blog lighter and easier to update, I tried to use CDNs to avoid copying  libraries
to my blog's files. So most of the libraries (like Bootstrap, jQuery, Font Awesome and so on)
are taken from remote servers instead of being served directly from the blog.

After this, I had all the static structure of the blog: the styles, icons, and so on. But I
still had to code the templates to render content.

The most important templates are `_layouts/default.html`, `_layouts/post.html` and `posts.html`
to develop them I took static HTMLs from the themes I downloaded and inserted the dynamic parts
following the [Jekyll reference] which is very useful and clear.

If you are deploying in Github and the pages are not updated, check the Github repository
settings (Github Pages section) to see if there is any error. Sometimes the blog builds locally
but fails to render in the server (checking this can save you a lot of time wondering what is
going wrong ;) trust me).
  
There are other templates that I picked from other Jekyll blogs, like these ones:

* The `atom.xml` and `_includes` files were taken from the [UP][up] theme. Note that UP's
  includes were modified for the blog.

* `sitemap.txt` and `rss.xml` were copied from [JekyllBootstrap].
  
To make syntax highlighting work, you need to install Pygments tool. It is very important that
you also generate the "syntax styles" for pygments. You can do this executing the following 
command: `pygmentize -S monokai -f  html > css/syntax.css` After running the previous command,
do not forget to include `syntax.css` in the pages where you intend to use syntax highlighting!


Blog usage
----------

To use the blog, I decided to use shell scripts instead a full blown build tool. In the end the
blog has to be maintained in Unix... so who cares about multiplatform.

The scripts are inside the `_bin` directory and they are used to generate the themes and the
icons.

To write posts and deploy them to the server, you will only need [Jekyll] and [Git]. These are
the most common actions:

* Launch blog locally: `jekyll serve --watch` after running that, you can see the blog in
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
* Deploy changes: `git add . && git commit && git push` will upload your latest changes to the
server.

Conclusion
----------

Starting a blog with [Jekyll] from scratch is way harder than using [JekyllBootstrap] or other 
blog engine. In exchange: you get flexibility, take advantage of your current knowledge (Git, 
HTML...) and you don't have to learn custom templates for closed products.

Also you will learn valuable things (about Web design and development) and have fun in the 
process!

As a side effect, I realized that static site generation can be useful for other purposes (not
only for blogs). For example, it can be used to generate software project's technical 
documentation.

Regarding the last point, I found a [Jekyll] wannabe in Java called [JBake] that looks very 
promising.

(Re)using it
------------

If you want to use the code for your own site, you can refer to the [readme.md] file and check
how to change it to suit your own needs.
